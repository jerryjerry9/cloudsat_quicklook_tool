notice that there are some limitations of the this script for now

The cloud object datasets now only cover 2006 to 2015

The himarwari and cloud object datasets now can collocate start from 2015 JULY

In the future, MODIS data would be involved to cover data period from 2006~2015/06

unfinished bug: if himarwari do not observe at cloud object time then the tool can not draw (but this situation is few)
